### About Brunchies
*Brunchies* is a full-stack business directory application that serves as a tool for users to locate prime brunch locations in San Francisco.  Users can search for a restaurant by name or filter their search by a restaurant's zipcode, rating, or price and Brunchies will dynamically generate all businesses that match the given filters. The *Yelp Fusion API* was utilized to pull business details and reviews which are displayed on each restaurant's page. Integration of the *Google Maps API* allows users to see saved restaurants pinned to a custom map on the user's profile.
